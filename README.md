# EcoChef
COMP-8967: PROJECT-1

## Features:
1. Real-Time Personalized Recipe Recommendations: Unlike traditional sources such as YouTube videos, recipe books, and websites that offer generic recipes, "EcoChef" utilizes machine learning to provide real-time, personalized recipe suggestions. This ensures users can efficiently use the ingredients they already have at home, minimizing food waste and unnecessary purchases.

2. Advanced Recipe Customization Features: "EcoChef" significantly enhances the meal preparation process by allowing users to input specific dietary preferences, allergies, available preparation time, and nutritional targets. This level of personalization not only ensures the safety and healthiness of meals but also aligns perfectly with individual lifestyle and dietary goals, increasing user satisfaction and convenience.
